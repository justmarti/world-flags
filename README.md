# World Flags üåç
*A minimalist flag game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.*

## About the Game
**World Flags** is a simple web game that challenges you to identify 10 random flags from around the world. Aim for a perfect 10/10 and put your knowledge to the test!  

With its **minimalist design**, **keyboard-friendly controls**, and built-in **score tracker**, the game is fast, intuitive, and keeps you motivated to improve. Think of it as a fun **flag quiz** you can play anytime.  

Play it online via **GitHub Pages** (see the repo description).

*Displayed flags are SVG images derived from the emoji flags of X (formerly known as Twitter), which I chose for their simplicity and visual appeal.*
